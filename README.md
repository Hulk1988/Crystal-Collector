# Crystal-Collector
Utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery languages.
Guessing game using crystals as numbers where the player will guess with numbers.
Four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
Player is shown random number at start of game.
When player clicks on a crystal it adds a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
The player wins the game if their total score matches random number and player loses if their total score goes above the random number.
Amount of points each crystal adds is hidden from player and their total score is displayed/updated after each crystal is clicked.
If player successfully total score matches the random number, the result is 1 win.
If player's total score > random number, result is 1 loss.

Assignment helped me to understand JQuery uses and applications.
One challenge that I faced was utilizing the math.random function to generate the random target number as well as the four crystal's values, which updated after each game.
